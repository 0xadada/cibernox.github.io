description: "A little about me. Who I am, what I like ..."
---

I was born in A Coruña (Coronna in English), a medium-sized city in the north-west coast of Spain, where I grew up.
A Coruña belongs to the region of Galicia, probably the most green and beautiful place in the Iberic Peninsula.

Right now I am living in London, home to his Majesty and the financial heart of Europe.

My father was a computer engineer and apparently inheritance gave me the same attributes, like the love for problem solving,
so I followed his steps in the [University of A Coruña](http://www.udc.es/index.html?language=en), at the
[Faculty of computer science](www.fic.udc.es).

I was interested in the web since I was a boy so I started learning web development, jumping from java to the dynamic
world of Ruby, Javascript and laterly also Go and some funtional languages (Elixir and Clojure).

In the personal side of my life, I'm a quiet guy that likes to do sports but you won't see me watching a football match, but playing one or going everywhere on my bike.

I also love animals _(who doens't?)_ and I have 2 cats, **Argon** and **Helia**. If I follow the noble gases rule,
probable my first dog will be called **Kripton**. You have to agree that it will be a kick-ass name for a dog!

I don't have much more to say. Go read the [stuff I write](/)
