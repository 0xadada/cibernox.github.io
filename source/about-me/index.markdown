I was born in A Coruña (Coronna in English), a medium-size city in the worth-west coast of Spain, where I grew up.
A Coruña belongs to the region of Galicia, probably (along with Asturias, the neighbour region) the most green a beautiful
place of the Iberic Peninsula.

Right now I live in Barcelona, an awesome city in the mediterranean sea. Sunny weather, good beaches and a
vibran ambiance make this city special, and I love it too.

My father was a computer engineer and, like in programming, inheritance gave me the same attributes, like the love for solving
problems just to probe I can, so I followed his steps in the [University of A Coruña](http://www.udc.es/index.html?language=en), at the
[Faculty of computer science](www.fic.udc.es).

I was interested in the web since I was a boy and I started to learn about web development, first in the dark side (java) and
then to the wonderful world of Ruby and other dynamic languages.

I am also very interested in other fields like functional languages (Erlang and Elixir) and User Experience.

In the personal side of my life, I'm a quiet guy who loves to **play** sports, not seeing sports. You won't see
me watching a football match, but you can always count on me for play a match, go running or mountain bike.

I also love animals _(who doens't?)_ and I have 2 cats, **Argon** and **Helia**. If I follow the noble gases rule,
probable my first dog will be called **Kripton**. You have to agree that this will be a kick-ass name for a dog!

I don't have much more to say. Go read the [stuff I write](/)
