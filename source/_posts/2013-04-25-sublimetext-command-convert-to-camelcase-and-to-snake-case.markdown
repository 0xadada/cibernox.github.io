I am a sublimetext fan. Is very very fast and customizable, and I created a couple commands to speed up my
productivity.

By convention, in ruby we use **CamelCase** for classes and modules and **snake_case** for method names and variables,
and may times I found me copying names and transforming from one to another.

For transfor the selected text into **lower** case there is already a command triggered by (in mac) `⌘K+⌘L`
For tranform into **upper** case, the command in `⌘K+⌘U`.
