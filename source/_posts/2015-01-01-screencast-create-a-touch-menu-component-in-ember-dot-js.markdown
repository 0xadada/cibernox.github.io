This post will be short because the content is a screencast (with 2 parts), in which I cover how to create

I've been working the last 6 months in The App Bussiness, which as you can imagine is a company fully
dedicated to create mobile apps, for iOS and Android. During this time I've learnt a bit about the
practices that make a UX a pleasure to use with your fingers. A lot of DOs and DONTs.

There is many curated resources to learn that, but I'd say that 99% are focused on native apps, and this
is kind of sad. There is very few mobile web apps that really take advantage of touch gestures, but
there is not technical reason for that.

We can build very nice touch UXs in HTML5, and Ember.js is as good as any other technology to help us
manage the complexity of those interfaces, so I've made a tutorial of how to create the (probably) most
widespead mobile UX pattern: The touch lateral slider menu:

seemed too much work, so the second part is only available in English.</small>
